# HTTP UI

This time we'll build on top of `http-api` and we will create `user interface` (UI) using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. We need to implement `3 views`

1. A view that allows you to create a new `paste`
2. A view that allows you to read a specific `paste`
3. A virw that allows you to get a list of all the `pastes`

> For (3) we'll need to add additional logic to our API
