- [how to setup an http server](https://pythonbasics.org/webserver/)

# Problems

- setup a simple http server that returns a static response `hello from server` on a `get request`
- setup a simple http server that reads the query parameters and if there is the parameter `name` the response should greed the name `hello {name}`
- introducde HTML to our server - instead of just returning the text `hello from servere` return a html file that contains `hello from server` but stylized
- read this HTML from a file
